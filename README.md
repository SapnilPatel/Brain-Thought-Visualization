# 🧠 BrainTV: Visualizing Thoughts from Brain Activity

BrainTV is a research project that leverages **fMRI brain activity recordings** to reconstruct and visualize the images a person is viewing.  
The system combines **deep learning**, **latent diffusion models**, and **masked autoencoders** to decode human vision and generate corresponding images.  

> 🏆 Selected for an **international hackathon organized by Nvidia and the National Supercomputing Mission (NSM)**.

## 🚀 Features
- Decodes **fMRI brain signals** into visual representations.
- Implements a **Double-Conditioned Latent Diffusion Model** for reconstruction.
- Uses **Masked Autoencoders (MAE)** for feature extraction.
- Achieves high fidelity in reconstructed images with metrics like **FID** and **SSIM**.
- Supports large-scale training on **GPU clusters**.
